# AI Internship Projects 
This repository contains the work and progress made during my internship at MettleByte Technologies. The projects I worked on primarily focused on developing advanced AI-driven solutions, including a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application and a LinkedIn Marketing Agent.

## Project Overview

### 1. RAG Application

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application aims to enhance the capabilities of chatbots and AI assistants by integrating efficient document retrieval and generation mechanisms.

**Key Features:**
- Utilizes large language models (LLMs) and LangChain for robust performance.
- Incorporates transformers for advanced text generation and understanding.
- Employs a vector database for storing and quickly retrieving document embeddings.

### 2. LinkedIn Marketing Agent

The LinkedIn Marketing Agent is designed to automate and optimize content creation and posting on LinkedIn, personalized for different users and companies.

**Key Features:**
- Scrapes LinkedIn profiles and posts to gather relevant data.
- Evaluates and selects the best open-source LLMs for generating content calendars and posts.
- Utilizes internet search capabilities to enhance the context and relevance of generated content.
- Integrates with the LinkedIn Developer API to automate posting and streamline workflows.
